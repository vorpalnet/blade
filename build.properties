# BLADE Properties
# Use this file to override any parameters.
# However, Do not modify “build.properties” directly.
# Instead, run 'ant' to create a copy of this file called: <hostname>.properties.
# Modify that file. This prevents multiple people from trying to modify
# the same properties file and accidentally checking it into the source code repository.

# Version Numbers, specification and implementation are tracked in "build.properties",
# but the build_number is tracked in your <hostname>.properties file.
specification=2.0
implementation=2.1.1

# The Oracle OCCAS home directory is one parameter that must be overridden. (See examples.)
# OCCAS71=C:\\Users\\jeff\\oracle\\occas-7.1

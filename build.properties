# BLADE Properties
# Use this file to override any parameters.
# However, Do not modify build.properties directly.
# Instead, run 'ant' to create a copy of this file called: <hostname>.properties.
# Modify that file. This prevents multiple people from trying to modify
# the same properties file and accidentally checking it into the source code repository.

# Do copy & modify these parameters
# The Oracle OCCAS home directory is one parameter that must be overridden. (See examples.)
#
# For Windows
# OCCAS=C:\\Users\\jeff\\oracle\\occas-8.1
#
# For Unix
# OCCAS=/home/jeff/oracle/occas-8.1

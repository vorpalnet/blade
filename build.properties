# BLADE Properties
# Use this file to override any parameters.
# However, Do not modify “build.properties” directly.
# Instead, run 'ant' to create a copy of this file called: <hostname>.properties.
# Modify that file. This prevents multiple people from trying to modify
# the same properties file and accidentally checking it into the source code repository.

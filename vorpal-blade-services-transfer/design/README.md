Types of callflows...

1. Blind, transfer and forget about it.
1. Assisted #1, call the target, verify they can help, then send transferee
1. Assisted #2, call the target, verify, call the transferee, transfer the call
1. Conference, all three agents talk on a conference call


Terminology:
- Unattended / Blind / Basic
- Attended / Assisted

Cisco uses Blind & Attended. Let's go with that.
